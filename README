This is vspcplay, a visual spc player and optimisation tool.

I used the code from the spc-xmms plugin, which uses the snes9x APU emulation
code. I updated the snes9x code using a newer version of snes9x (I dont remember
which version exactly).

The display code is mine. 

*** WARNING WARNING WARNING!
I coded this really fast and added feature after feature without any planning and minimal
thinking. The code is really *really* ugly.

The homepage for this project is http://vspcplay.raphnet.net

Have fun,
