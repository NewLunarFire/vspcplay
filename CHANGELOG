-- v1.3
  Added command line options to replace the unused bytes in a spc file by a given pattern. By doing
  this you can increase compressibility of files:
    --apply_mask_block  Apply the mask to the file (replace unused blocks(256 bytes) with pattern)
	--filler val        Set the pattern byte value. Use with the option above. Default 0 
	
  Also bundled tools to apply mask files to spc files in the utils/ subdir.

  terminal).
  Reads in the sample directory were not reported (Resulting in unusable
  masks)
